        <h2>Why I'm doing this</h2>
        <p>Ever the undecisive bachelor (<em>sorry, I'm taken</em>) A couple of close friends managed to somehow
            convince me to begin constructing my own portfolio to learn and embrace coding.
            <br /><br /> There are many hurdles I'll need to overcome with <strong>much</strong> googling, but I'm
            certain I'll be able to sit back and be proud of what I made.</p>

        <h3>Project Purpose</h3>
        <p>This project's purpose it to fulfill two personal goals of mine. The first is to teach myself (with the help
            of some great friends) how to become a software engineer. <br><br> The second and most important goal, is to
            create a way to support non-profit
            organizations in a positive yet effective manner. As time passes I look forward to seeing how this project
            evolves.
