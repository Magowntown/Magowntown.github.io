        <h2>Why I'm doing this</h2>
        <p>Ever the undecisive bachelor (<em>sorry, I'm taken</em>) A couple of close friends managed to somehow convince me to begin constructing my own portfolio to learn and embrace coding.
            <br /><br /> There are many hurdles I'll need to overcome with <strong>much</strong> googling, but I'm certain I'll be able to sit back and be proud of what I made.</p>
        <h3>Goals</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
