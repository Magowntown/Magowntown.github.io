        <h3>Project Purpose</h3>
        <p>This project's purpose it to fulfill two personal goals of mine. The first is to teach myself (with the help
            of some great friends) how to become a software engineer. <br><br> The second and most important goal, is to
            create a way to support non-profit
            organizations in a positive yet effective manner. As time passes I look forward to seeing how this project
            evolves.
